			The Yorkshire business Collective is a group of like-minded, independent consultants and business service providers who engage directly with clients on their own account. <br>
			The one stop shop for business advice in South Yorkshire. <br>
			Whilst YBC is not a consultancy in its own right, our members can work together to provide a complete strategic solution for your business... <br>
			...or you can cherry pick the individual service you require.
