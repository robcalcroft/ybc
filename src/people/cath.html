		<section>
			<span class="bold">Consultancy</span> – Every organisation and every manager can sometimes benefit from an objective perspective that brings expertise in a given area. An external consultant can bring new proven idea’s to consider; they will work with you to tackle barriers or accelerate progress; or can simply act as a sounding board to evaluate options and develop/implement action plans.

		<section>
			<span class="bold">Training</span> - To make learning effective people need to be motivated and inspired to see how the learning will improve their day to day working lives and their self development. We involve, interact and strive to deliver a learning experience that is relevant, fun and effective. Most of our work is bespoke around the needs of the client, however we can also offer more standardized learning packages, should that meet your need.

			<span class="bold">1-1 Coaching - what is it?</span> Coaching is a series of structured non-judgemental conversations in a confidential and safe environment.  The objective is to maximise the individual’s ability to take positive action that will move them towards corporate and personal goals and learn from the experience. It is based on underpinning agreed corporate goals and may be supplemented with more personal and confidential ambitions. Corporate progress will be recorded and shared periodically with the line manager in order to evaluate success. Typically it is delivered over a period of 2-6 months.

		<section>
			<span class="bold">Group Coaching</span> - (Sometimes called action learning) is a form of structured coaching, similar to that outlined above, but delivered in a group environment. Individual and/or group goals are agreed at the outset. The group meets periodically to review activity, provides support and challenge for the individual and generates ideas as issues arise. The added benefits of this approach include shared learning, relationship building and cost effectiveness.
